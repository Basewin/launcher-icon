# Bertha, a launcher icon sample
Bertha is a simple demo project that showcases how to set up Android launcher icons and shortcuts, for all versions of Android up to O (8.0.0, API 26) included.

This showcases:
 * **"Legacy" launcher icons** for Android versions up to 7.0 Nougat (API 24)
    * These icons can have a background, but in this case, they don't, as most apps from that era didn't<br/>
      (unless they had lazy designers or logos that had a background)
    * Must use PNGs as vector drawables and WEBP images were not supported for launcher icons
 * **Round launcher icons** for Android 7.1 Nougat (API 25)
    * Originally used in the Pixel launcher to have visual coherency
    * Replaced by Adaptive Icons in Android O (see next bullet point)                        
    * Must use PNGs as vector drawables and WEBP images were not supported for launcher icons
 * **Adaptive Icons** for Android 8.0 O (API 26) and later
    * Can use vector drawables (finally)
    * Different canvas size, 108dp, with a 72dp visible area
    * Safe area is actually a circle with a 66dp diameter, not a square
    * Composed of background and foreground layers, mask is provided by the launcher
    * Can be animated (but aren't yet as of Android O Developer Preview 3)
 * **Launcher shortcuts** for Android 7.1 Nougat (API 25) and later
    * Accessed via long-press or other gestures
    * Useful for deeplinks (in this case, they set the image in the app)
    * Not demoed here are dynamic shortcuts, only the static shortcuts
